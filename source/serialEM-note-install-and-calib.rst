   Abstract
      When I helped a few sites to install and calibrate SerialEM, I had
      impression that most new users felt this process was very hard. I felt
      the same way when I initially learned to install and calibate SerialEM
      by myself. I even got frustrated and had to call David for a few
      times. When I think back about all the troubles I had to install and
      calibrate SerialEM, I believe I would have an easier time if I had a
      brief guideline document for what steps to follow in order, and what
      to do in each step. The helpfile from SerialEM is very complete to
      provide almost all information needed, but it is perhasp a lot to read
      and not clear where to start for a beginner. 
      
      I wanted to list some steps here to guide you through this initial
      installation and calibration phase. It is like a crash list. For more
      detailed information, you should always find it from helpfile. 
      
.. _installation:

Installation 
------------

Here are steps to follow. 

.. rubric:: Step 1

- Ask David for the initial system file. Normally, you would fill out a "questionnaire" available at the ftp server - http://bio3d.colorado.edu/ftp/SerialEM/questionnaire.txt and send it to David. David or Guenter Resch will then create a framework file on the same ftp server for you to download. This framework file is a zip file, you can download it to local like Desktop and unzip it by double clicking on the file. Beside a sub-folder "Admin" created under "C:\\ProgramData\\SerialEM", the most important file in the framework is one initial system file called "SerialEMproperties.txt". You must have this file to get started. Please refer to the SerialEM webpage for the latest information regarding this.

.. rubric:: Step 2

- Make sure your camera computer and microscope computers are on the same local network. For example, K2/3 computer can be configured to have a network interface with IP address 192.168.1.2, and FEI scope with 192.168.1.1. And they should be able to *ping* each other.  - You might be confused by Gatan's DM already being able to communicate with scope, as it can detect magnification change of scope. However, this DM connection to scope is usually via serial port by a direct serial cable. SerialEM uses standard TCP/IP to communicate to a remote computer and therefore requires a standard network setup in place.  - If you configured the local network, you should have DM communicate to scope (via Gatan's RemoteTEM) using TCP/IP too. It is a lot more robust. But this is not a concern for SerialEM operation here.  

.. rubric:: Step 3

- Decide which computer to install SerialEM. In theory, you can install SerialEM on either computer - camera or microscope. For K2/3 camera, SerialEM should be normally installed on the K2/3 computer, as K2/3 image returning to SerialEM locally is usually faster than via network.  

.. rubric:: Step 4

- Decide which type of executable to use. SerialEM builds for both 32 and 64-bit platforms. Unless you have to run it on a Windows XP, you should choose 64-bit. 

.. rubric:: Step 5

- Download SerialEM software. You should start with the latest release version from ftp server at http://bio3d.colorado.edu/ftp/SerialEM/  and save it somewhere local like Desktop.  

.. rubric:: Step 6

- Unzip the installation package file downloaded. You can double click on this file, it will unzip the program into C:\\Program Files\\SerialEM. The folder "SerialEM" will be created automatically if there isn't one already.  The new package content will be unzipped into a new sub-folder, e.g.  SerialEM_3-6-13_64. 

.. rubric:: Step 7

- Quit Gatan DM if it is running. 

.. rubric:: Step 8

- Right click on a file called *install.bat* in the package folder C:\\Program Files\\SerialEM\\SerialEM_3-6-13_64 and select 'Run as Administrator'. This will copy some files into upper folder which is C:\\Program Files\\SerialEM, register DM plugin file and copy it to the Gatan plugin folder at C:\\ProgramData\\Gatan\\Plugin.

.. rubric:: Step 9

- Manually copy a file called *FEI-SEMServer.exe* from C:\\Program Files\\SerialEM on K2/3 computer to C:\\Program Files\\SerialEM on scope computer. This is a bridging program to control scope by passing the scope function calls between SerialEM main program on remote K2/3 computer and the scope scripting interface. Run the program by double clicking on it(it needs to run or SerialEM cannot control scope). This is 32-bit application, runs on both 32 and 64-bit Windows platforms. So there is only one such executable to run on Windows 7, XP or 2000 Windows OS. 

.. rubric:: Step 10

- On K2/3 computer, Edit *SerialEMproperties.txt* file in folder C:\\ProgramData\\SerialEM to have proper lines in general property area to define network properties. 

.. code-block:: ruby

   #GatanServerIP 192.168.1.2
   GatanServerIP 127.0.0.1
   GatanServerPort 48890 
   SocketServerIP 1 192.168.1.1
   SocketServerPort 1 48892

.. rubric:: Step 11

- On K2/3 computer where SerialEM is to be installed, define a system environment variable SERIALEMCCD_PORT with the value 48890 or other selected port number, as described in the section in helpfile. 

- If everything goes well, you should be able to start SerialEM and it should connect to "see" both scope and DM. Congratulations!

.. _Calibration:

Calibration 
-----------

Although most of calibration results will be written into another system
file *SerialEMcalibraions.txt* when you save the calibrtion from Calibretion
menu, there are a few places you need to manully edit the
*SerialEMproperties.txt* to take in the calibration results. These include
pixelsize and tilting axis angle - they are more like instrument parameters. 

For pixelsize calibration, it is best to use standard 2160 line waffle grid.
For all other calibration like Image Shift and Stage Shift, it would make
things a lot easier to use a non-periodic sample. Please see the *NOTE* at
the end of this document. 

.. tip:: 

   Since ÂµP and nP modes give very different beams, it is required to
   perform calibration for **both** modes for some basic items:
  
   - Beam Crossover
   - Beam Intensity
   - Spot Intensity
   - Beam Shift
   - Autofocus
   - Electron Dose
   - Standard Focus
   
   See https://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/betaHlp/html/setting_up_serialem.htm#nanoprobe

.. rubric:: Step 0 

- Determine camera orientation configuration. Make sure the image orientation from camera shot agree with that of on large screen or FluCam.  If it doesn't, try to adjust the camera orientation of Gatan K2/3 camera from Camera - Configuration. You can use beamstop to help.  You should add a property entry to reflect the DM configuration so SerialEM takes care of it even someone might have changed DM configuration. 

.. code-block:: ruby

   DMRotationAndFlip 7

.. rubric:: Step 1

- Edit property file to define the camera configuration information about orientation determined by step 0. SerialEM will return to main display with proper orientation. This is initial starting point for all the calibrations.

.. code-block:: ruby

   RotationAndFlip 7

.. rubric:: Step 2

- SerialEM - Calibration - List Mag. Scope will go through all the mags and list them on log window, from lowest to highest. Check it with what are in *SerialEMproperties.txt*, update that if needed.  

.. rubric:: Step 3

- Load standard waffle grating grid (TedPella Prod.# 607, http://www.tedpella.com/calibration_html/TEM_STEM_Test_Specimens.htm#_607).

.. rubric:: Step 4

- Start with lowest magnification above LM range. On Talos, it is 1250X. At close to Eucentricity, and clost to eucentric focus. 

.. rubric:: Step 5

- Take a T shot with 2x binning on a K2/3 camera, make sure the counts are neither too low nor too high. 

.. rubric:: Step 6

- Take a T shot, then Calibration - Pixel Size - Find Pixel Size. The log window shows both mag index and pixel size. Edit *SerialEMproperties.txt* to add a line like below in K2/3 camera property section. 

.. code-block:: ruby

   # MagIndex  DeltaRotation (999 not measured)  SolvedRotation (999 not measured)   Pixel size (nm, 0 not measured)
   RotationAndPixel 17 999 999 3.396
   
Here, 17 is mag index for 1250X, and 3.396 is pixel size in nm just
calibrated.

.. rubric:: Step 7 

- You might want to change to a grid without repeating features, please see "note" at the end of this document. 

- Calibration - Image & Stage Shift - IS from Scratch.

.. rubric:: Step 8

- Calibration - Image & Stage Shift - Stage Shift.

.. rubric:: Step 9

- Calibration - Administrator, turn it on.

.. rubric:: Step 10

- Calibration - Save Calibration. 

.. rubric:: Step 11

- Take the tilting axis value (e.g. 86.1) from step 8 - stage shift
calibration, edit it into the 2nd "999" in *SerialEMproperties.txt* like
below.

.. code-block:: ruby

   RotationAndPixel 17 999 86.1 3.396

.. Note:: 

   The pixel size and tilting axis can just be done for a couple of
   switching mags such as the lowest M and the highest LM.  SerialEM uses
   these couple of calibrations and all the Image Shift calibration to
   interpolate to obtain the pixelsizes and tilting axis angles for all
   other magnifications. This is very cute. 

.. rubric:: Step 12

- Increase Mag by 1 click and do Calibration - Image & Stage Shift - Image Shift

.. rubric:: Step 13

- Repeat above step to cover all the magnification till the highest to be used such as 100kX. 

.. rubric:: Step 14

- Decrease Mag by 1 click and do Calibration - Image & Stage Shift - Image Shift

.. rubric:: Step 15

- Repeat above step to cover all magnification till the lowest to use like 46X. 

.. rubric:: Step 16

- At about 20kX, do Autofocus calibration (only need to do at single mag).

.. rubric:: Step 17

- Beam Crossover calibration

.. rubric:: Step 18

- Start with most used spotsize like 7, do Beam Intensity calibration 

.. rubric:: Step 19

- repeat Beam Intensity Calibration for all other spot sizes likely to be
used: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9.

.. rubric:: Step 20

- At one mag like 5000X, using spot size 9, do Beam Shift Calibration (only need to do at single mag).

.. rubric:: Step 21 

- Usually, people use the lowest M mag for Low Dose View beam and with large defocus offset such as -200 or -300 microns. You need to the calibrate High-Defocus Mag for this View mag. This will make stage shifts still good for such large defocus, as they are interpolated for the defocus offset. 

.. Note::

   - Calibrations needed to be done for *both* ÂµP and nP mode include: *beam
   crossover*, *beam intensity*, *beam shift* and *autofocus*.
   
   - Waffle grating grid is good and handy for pixel size calibration, but
   it is not ideal for Image Shift and Stage Shift calibrations, as the
   waffle pattern might screw up the correlation in the calibration
   procedures. I found the normal Quantifoil grid with some 10nm Au
   particles absorbed onto can be very good for normal calibration purpose.
   I glow discharge a Quantifoil grid and add 1 *Âµl* deca-gold solution on
   the grid and let it dry. 
   
   - I found that standard **PtIr** grid for TFS to perform Thon Ring test
   also works very well for calibration purpose. 
   
   - Most of SerialEM actions are cross-correlation based, including
   calibrating. Therefore, a clean and recent preparation of camera gain
   reference file is desired, because it will help to have less screw-up due
   to fixed noise pattern dominating the cross-correlation.
