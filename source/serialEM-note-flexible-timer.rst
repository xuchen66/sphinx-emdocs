   Abstract
      Note about the flexible timer available for scripting and an example
      how to use it.

Background information 
----------------------

In SerialEM scripting, there are a few commands with timer built in. For
example, command ``LongOperation`` can take a few specific actions with
timer defined.  Here is one of the example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   LongOperation Da 3 
  
This will perform dark reference for K2/K3 camera every 3 hours. This is
very handy indeed. Another example is ``RefineZLP``.

.. code-block:: ruby
   
   RefineZLP 30
   
This will perform refining ZLP every 30 minutes. 
   
However, if we want to set a timer and to do a multiple and general actions
when time is up, a more flexible timer is needed. In the case shown in
picture below, which is Au-foil grid, we use multiple hole mechanism to
collected images in these 4 holes using beam-image shift while the stage is
centered at the middle of the 4 hole pattern. When the procedure is
finished, the shift is reset and Record beam would be hitting on the black
Au crystals. 

**Fig.1 4-hole black Au crystals**

.. image:: ../images/Au-4-holes.png
   :scale: 100 %
..   :height: 544 px
   :width: 384 px
   :alt: DUMMY instance property
   :align: center

It is known that this kind of black crystal film is bad for ``refineZLP``
routine to work properly. It needs to use a hole area to make it work. As
you can see, a simple timer built in for a specific function is not
sufficient here. Two actions are needed: 1) move to one of the four holes
and 2) perform RefineZLP. It requires a more flexible timer to do this.

Flexible Timer 
--------------

A typical timer which could handle multiple actions would be like this:

.. code-block:: ruby

   If time is up
      do task1 
      do task2
      ...
   EndIf
   
One of the script commands related to timer is ``SetCustomTime``. Below is
example code to perform two actions mentioned above.

.. code-block:: ruby

   SetCustomTime ZLP       # start timer 

Then you can use the timer to do things based elaped time.

.. code-block:: ruby

   ### move to a hole and refineZLP every 30 minutes
   ReportCustomInterval ZLP
   if $repVal1 >= 30
       StageToLastMultiHole
       #ImageShiftToLastMultiHole
       RefineZLP              # refine now
       SetCustomTime ZLP      # reset it
   Endif
