   Abstract
      At UMASS Cryo-EM Facility, we use SerialEM to collect data for both
      single particle and tomography applications.  And we do that on both
      Talos Arctica and Titan Krios with K2 cameras. 
      
      For single particle, usually we save frames in compressed TIFF format
      without gain normalized (select Dark Substracted in camera setup
      window). One of the advantages of doing this is to reduce data size.
      For Super-resolution frames, the raw frame data is in unsigned 4-bit.
      Pixel values are in the range of 0 - 15. For weak beam, there are a
      lot of zeros there too. With lossless compression methods, such data
      can be comprssed into much smalller filesize without losing image
      information. Therefore, instead of applying gain normalized reference
      to all the frames, we leave the raw data compressed and saved to the
      disk and we later do post-processing to recover the full information
      of the image data. 
      
      In this doc, the procedures to do post processing are presented here
      for your reference. 

.. _k2-on-Talos:

For K2 camera on Talos Arctica 
------------------------------

The DM camera configuration for camera orientation setup for K2 camera on
Talos Arctica is 270 degree rotation and Flip along Y. The idea is that with
a proper orientation setup, the image from camera is at the same orientation
as on FluCam. This is initial condition for SerialEM setup. 

However, when saving frames from single particle data collection, this
orientation might not always be needed. As long as all the data is saved the
same way for the entire session, it is fine with and without this
orientation applied to all the frames before saving. This option is from a
check box "Save frames without rotation/flip to standard orientation" in K2
Frame File Option dialog window.  

If you saved frame as un-normalized TIFF, and you need to recover the image
stack to a MRC format and apply gain reference file and mast out defects,
here are steps.

1. check out the orietation from header of the file. 

.. code-block:: none

   $header YURI_B1_G1-SuperRes_636_Feb05_10.42.09.tif

   RO image file on unit   1 : YURI_B1_G1-SuperRes_636_Feb05_10.42.09.tif     Size=     805815 K

                       This is a TIFF file.

      1 Titles :
   SerialEMCCD: Dose frac. image, scaled by 1.00  r/f 0


The last parameter in title line shows the orientation of imaging. Here is 0
- no rotation and no flip. In this case, Gatan gain reference file doesn't
need to do any rotation and flip. We simply convert it into MRC format. 

2. Convert Gatan gain reference .dm4 into MRC format. 

.. code-block:: none

   $dm2mrc GatanGainRef.dm4 GatanGainRef.mrc
   
3. Use "clip" to apply gain reference and deal with defects all in a single
command line (later IMOD can take tiff file format as input directly). I
quote a section from SerialEM helpfile here:

<helpfile>

       Once you have the reference in the right orientation, you can use the
       program 'clip' in IMOD to apply gain normalization (and defect
       correction with version 4.8.6 or higher).  In the following,
       'scalingFactor' is the regular scaling factor applied to summed
       images, 'fileWithFrames' is the data file to normalize,
       'gainReference.mrc' is the reoriented gain reference, and
       'normalizedFrames.mrc' is the desired output file. The alternatives
       for GMS 2.3.0 or lower are:

       Counting mode, not packed:  The data need to be scaled to preserve
       precision after normalization.  The command is
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
            clip mult -n scalingFactor  fileWithFrames.mrc  gainReference.mrc  normalizedFrames.mrc
       
       Super-resolution mode, not packed:  The data need to be scaled to
       preserve precision after normalization.  To have the same scaling by
       16 that the plugin would apply, the command is
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
            clip mult -n 16  fileWithFrames  gainReference.mrc  normalizedFrames.mrc
            
       but if you want to apply the regular scaling factor, the output will
       need to be integers and the command is
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
            clip mult -n scalingFactor  -m 1  fileWithFrames  gainReference.mrc  normalizedFrames.mrc
       
       Counting mode, packed as bytes:  The data need to be scaled to
       preserve precision and output as integers to preserve the range.  The
       command is
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
            clip mult -n scalingFactor  -m 1  fileWithFrames  gainReference.mrc  normalizedFrames.mrc
       
       Super-resolution mode, packed as 4-bit numbers: By default, the data
       will be scaled by 16 when unpacking with normalization, so the
       command to get this scaling is just
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
            clip unpack  fileWithFrames  gainReference.mrc  normalizedFrames.mrc
       
       but if you want to apply the regular scaling factor, the output will
       need to be integers and the command is
       
       .. code-block:: none
       
            clip unpack -n scalingFactor  -m 1  fileWithFrames  gainReference.mrc  normalizedFrames.mrc
       
       It is also possible to remove extreme values from the data at the
       same time with the '-h' and '-l' options.  For example, adding '-h 6
       -l 1' after the 'unpack' will replace all values above 6 with 1.

       To apply defect correction to files from GMS 2.3.1 or higher, add '-D
       defects...txt' before 'fileWithFrames' in the appropriate command,
       where 'defects...txt' is the file saved by the plugin.
       
       In IMOD version 4.8.41 or higher, all programs can read 4-bit files
       directly.  The 'clip unpack' command has thus been changed so that it
       can be used for normalizing any kind of data, and it can also be
       invoked as either 'clip unpack' or 'clip norm'.  A command that works
       for all of the above cases is

       .. code-block:: none

            clip norm -n scalingFactor  -m 1  fileWithFrames  gainReference.mrc normalizedFrames.mrc
                
       Where the default scaling factor is 16, extreme values can be removed
       with '-l' and '-h' options, and '-D defects...txt' would be added for
       files from GMS 2.3.1 or higher.  With IMOD 4.9.2/4.10.1 or higher,
       you can add add '-R -1' and use the DM reference directly instead of
       a rotated reference.

       For K3 frames, you should specify a scaling factor of 32.
