   Abstract
     We found that it was extremly useful to be able to make Low Mag Montage (LMM) maps for all the grids in autoloader 
     cassette automatically. Since it can take a while for multiple grids, you should give yourself a good break while 
     scope is busy working without feeling guilty.   
      
.. _procedure:

Procedure
---------

Here are steps to follow. 

1. Dock the cassette. After temperature in the autoloader recovers, do *Inventory*.
#. Setup image condition. I do it inside or SerialEM Low-Dose mode. I use **Search** area for the job. On our Krios with GIF/K2, 
   I set mag for **Search** as 220X (I cannot go lower as wish, because some hardware piece in lower portion of column will
   start to cut into image.). 
#. Setup proper exposure and binning for **Search** parameter from camera control panel. I usually use binning 2, 
   exposure 1 seconds, and in Linear mode (mP mode, Spotsize 8).
#. Take a *Search* shot, make sure the count value is proper, no beam/aperture edge in the image. 
#. Navigator - Montaging & Grids -  Setup Full Montage. Make sure **Search** is checked in the montage setup dialog window.
   Define a file like LMM.map. 
#. Edit script **Cars** to reflect cartridge and sample information, like below:

.. code-block:: 
   :linenos:
   :caption: Cars.txt

    ScriptName Cars

    # script of cartridges information 

    rootDir = X:\Munan_20180402
    cat = { 2 3 4 5 6 7 }
    name = { 56-g1 56-g2 56-g3 56-g4 54-g2 54-g4 }

    SetDirectory $rootDir 
    ReportDirectory 

    If $#cat != $#name
        Echo     >>> Arrays "cat" and "name" have different length, exit ...
        Exit
    else
        echo     cat = { $cat }
        echo name = { $name }
    Endif
    
Here you define folder location, cartridge #, and sample names. The map filename will have the info in it, such as 
``LMM-Car2-56-g1.st``. 

7. Now run the Script **LMMCars** as below:

.. code-block:: ruby
   :linenos:
   :caption: LMMCars.txt

    ScriptName LMMCars
    # LMM for multiple cartriges, assumes the montage file opened.

    ##########################
    # navigator must be open
    ##########################
    Call Cars
    
    ##### No editing Below ############
    CallFunction LMMCars
    ## in the end,  rise mag to settle temp & Close the valves
    #GoToLowDoseArea  V
    SetColumnOrGunValve 0
    
    ###############################################################
    Function LMMCars 0 0 

    Loop $#cat index
       LoadCartridge $cat[$index]
       #SetNavRegistration $cat[$index]
       SetColumnOrGunValve 1
       MoveStageTo 0 0 
       OpenNewMontage 0 0 LMM-Car$cat[$index]-$name[$index].st
       Montage 
       NewMap
       CloseFile
    EndLoop 

    EndFunction 

.. _convert_to_jpeg:

Convert LMM maps into JPEG format 
----------------------------------

For easy display and small file size, we usually convert all the maps in MRC format to JPEG. 

   - Set Bin Overview to 1 on Montage control panel (default is usually higher than 1 with montage from command)
   - Load the map file, the overview will be displayed in a specific buffer such as Q
   - Run a small script 
   
.. code-block:: ruby
   :linenos:
   :caption: LMM->JPEG.txt

   ScriptName LMM->JPEG
   # convert to JPEG format for easy display
   
   SetDirectory X:\Munan_20180402
   
   # reduced image for good JPEG density range, redeuced one will be in A
   ReduceImage Q 2     
   SaveToOtherFile A JPEG JPEG LMM-Car2-56-g1.jpeg
   
.. note::

   - The JPEG image generated from above script is *true* JEPG file, not a JPG compressed TIFF file as before. Compressed JPG cannot be displayed properly by Photoshop and ImageJ, although preview, paint and webbroser can show them nicely. 
   - You can also convert MMM maps and single shot MRC image the same way.
