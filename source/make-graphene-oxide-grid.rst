   Abstract
      This protocol is based on MRC LMB one. We modify the protocol based on
      Xudong Wu's method at Harvard Medical School.
      
      
.. _material:

Materials and Equipment Used:
-----------------------------

1. GO Solution (Sigma:763705, 2 mg/ml)
#. ddH\ :sub:`2`\ O
#. Tweezers
#. Pipette (1 µl, 3 µl and 20 µl)
#. Tabletop centrifuge
#. Parafilm
#. Whatman filter paper No.1

.. _procedure:

Procedure:
----------

1. Dilute GO solution 10x to 0.2 mg/mL with ddH\ :sub:`2`\ O
2. Sonicate for 15s to break up aggregates
#. Spin for 30 seconds at 300 rcf to remove aggregates
#. Prepare a flat and clean working area (e.g. with parafilm)
#. Further dilute GO solution 10x to 0.02 mg/mL with ddH\ :sub:`2`\ O
#. Glow discharge grids with carbon side up (easiGlow (PELCO, Discharge
   System); Quantifoil Cu 300 R1.2/1.3 120 seconds at 0.2 mBar and 15 mA)
#. Take up grids with anti-capillary tweezers
#. Place 1µl of the diluted GO solution (4) on the carbon side of the grid
#. Wait for the grid to dry out

.. Note::

   1. This method is good for high coverage of GO, but maybe get multiple
      layers of GO on the grid. 
   2. Discharging conditions are varied between grids and discharge system.
