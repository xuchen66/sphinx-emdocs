 Goal 
    The goal of the training we offer is to help a new user coming to EM
    field to learn some basic knowledge and skill of Cryo-EM. Hopefully, at
    the end of these two levels of training sessions, you will be able to
    screen your negative stained specimen and cryo grids on a TEM scope
    without too much difficult.

 Requirement 
    You are not required to have experience with TEM operation. Certainly,
    we could progress faster if you have some basic knowledge about a TEM.
    The only requirement to you, the fresh trainee,  is to have a spirit of
    commitment. You need to be determined to learn this new technique. If
    you think to have your data collected while in your training session and
    have your project done half way, you should not attend the training
    session that we offer. You will be wasting your own time, let alone
    ours. Usually, if an user doesn't take good note during training session
    and doesn't come back to practise on microscope, that is a good hint
    that the user is *not* serious at it. Operating a transmission electron
    microscope is very much like  driving a car - you need to be serious and
    to practise if you really want to learn it!

This document lists the training contents that these two-level, 8 sessions will cover.
