   Abstract
      In cisTEM when you close the main window, all running jobs are
      terminated. Xpra is a window server that saves the state of graphical
      applications so that you can detach from your cisTEM session and have
      it run in the background.

      https://xpra.org/ "Xpra is an open-source multi-platform persistent
      remote display server and client for forwarding applications and
      desktop screens.  ... it allows you to run programs, usually on a
      remote host, direct their display to your local machine, and then to
      disconnect from these programs and reconnect from the same or another
      machine, without losing any state."


.. _install_Xpra:

Installing Xpra on Linux
------------------------

1. Download the Xpra repository information into your system's package
manager folder.
         
   For our Centos 7 system,
         
.. code-block:: ruby
        
   sudo bash -c "curl https://xpra.org/repos/CentOS/xpra.repo > /etc/yum.repos.d/xpra.repo"
        
Xpra also supports Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu. For Debian and Ubuntu, the
package manager folder is /etc/apt/sources.list.d

2. Install
      
For Centos and Fedora,
   
.. code-block:: ruby
   
   sudo yum install xpra
   
For Debian and Ubuntu,
   
.. code-block:: ruby
   
   sudo apt install xpra

.. _usage_examples:

Usage Examples
--------------

1. Log into the cisTEM computer from your remote computer. You will need
   less strict X forwarding with the -Y option.
        
.. code-block:: ruby
        
   ssh -Y username@ipaddress
   
2. Start a cisTEM process using xpra. You will need to choose a sessionID
   number. I arbitrarily chose 100.
   
.. code-block:: ruby
   
   xpra start :100 --start-child=cisTEM
         
Hit enter one more time, and now the session has been created in the
background. You will have to attach to it. 

3. Attach to the session. From the cisTEM computer,
         
.. code-block:: ruby
         
   xpra attach :100
    
and the cisTEM window should open. If there is only one session, you don't
need the :100

4. Detach from the session. From the command line, hit Ctrl-C and the window
will disappear. 

.. Note::

   when re-attaching: Usually remote connections from outside the local
   network are laggy. Fortunately, Xpra has compressions to lessen the
   amount of bandwidth. To enable compression when reattaching, do

   .. code-block:: ruby

      xpra attach --encoding=rgb --compress=1

   This is the recommended way from Xpra.org.
