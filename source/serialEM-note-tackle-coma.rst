   Abstract
      For high resolution data, coma is always a concern or something we
      don't want to miss or ignore.  With image-beam shift, even on a
      carefully aligned, coma-free scope, there might always be some coma
      induced by the shift.  On the other hand, if we can collect CryoEM
      data with some image shift, that would increase the effciency a lot.
      The question is how much worse the data becomes with certain mount of
      image shift in the shots. A more important question is if we can have
      a way to correct coma that is induced by the image-beam shift. 
      
      In this note, I try to explain how to assess coma induced by the
      shift, more or less quantitatively and how to correct the coma using
      currently available functions in SerialEM. 
      
      This is very fresh, work in progress, both in SerialEM and this
      document.

Background
----------

The coma we discuss here is axial coma. It is how much the incident
direction of electron beam is off from perfect optical axis. This small
angle makes electron beam hitting on specimen not perpendicularly. The
effect might not be easily seen visually and directly from a typical single
particle electron image, but it is very real. If you look at inorganic
material lattice image in electron microscope, a tiny alpha angle change will
make the lattice image no longer even and symmetric. For single particle
image, this introduces a phase error because we assume all the images are
taken with perpendicular incident beam. It is hard or almost impossible to
correct this error from all the images taken with coma, at least for single
particle images. Therefore, if we can eliminate this error experimentally,
that would be a good thing to do.

Align scope to minimize coma
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are tools from microscope operating software interface. For example,
in FEI Tecnai/Talos/Titan interface, there are Rotation Center and Coma-Free
alignment you can use to minimize this instrument parameter. You might call
this manual alignment. 

There are also seperate tools (programs) to align the scope for coma-free
purpose in more automated fashion. FEI has Auto-CTF, Leginon uses Zemlin
plateau method to correct coma; SerialEM also has its own built-in functions
to do coma-free alignment. In SerialEM, the two functions are called `BTID
Coma-free Alignment
<http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/hlp/html/menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_coma>`_
and `Coma-free alignment by CTF
<http://bio3d.colorado.edu/SerialEM/hlp/html/menu_focus.htm#hid_focus_coma_by_ctf>`_.
One uses beam tilt induced displacement (BTID) and other uses fitted CTF
information. CTF method is quick and accurate, but it does require clear
Thon rings to fit. It gives options to use full 9-piece panel (Zemlin
plateau) or 5-piece method. They work fairly well to my eyes. 

Linearity relationship between Image Shift and Induced Beam Tilt
----------------------------------------------------------------

With the built-in tools to correct and measure coma, it is possible to study
the behavior of beam tilt induced by image shift. On a well aligned scope,
image shift still introduces extra beam tilt, because the beam is no longer
on axis anymore, and alignment for beam shift pivot points perhaps is never
accurate enough. This is known, but the relationship between the them was
not clear. 

With the latest version, we can run following SerialEM script (this is
modified from the David Mastronade's original one) to learn the behaviors. 

.. code-block:: ruby

   ScriptName BTvsIS
   extent = { 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 }
   FixComaByCTF
   Loop $#extent ind
      ReportImageShift xbase ybase
      SetImageShift $xbase + $extent[$ind]  $ybase
      FixComaByCTF 1 1
      ReportComaTiltNeeded xpxplus ypxplus
      SetImageShift $xbase - $extent[$ind]  $ybase
      FixComaByCTF 1 1
      ReportComaTiltNeeded xpxminus ypxminus
      SetImageShift $xbase  $ybase + $extent[$ind]
      FixComaByCTF 1 1
      ReportComaTiltNeeded xpyplus ypyplus
      SetImageShift $xbase  $ybase - $extent[$ind]
      FixComaByCTF 1 1
      ReportComaTiltNeeded xpyminus ypyminus
      SetImageShift $xbase  $ybase
      xpx = ($xpxplus - $xpxminus) / (2 * $extent[$ind])
      ypx = ($ypxplus - $ypxminus) / (2 * $extent[$ind])
      xpy = ($xpyplus - $xpyminus) / (2 * $extent[$ind])
      ypy = ($ypyplus - $ypyminus) / (2 * $extent[$ind])
      echo extent = $extent[$ind]  matrix = $xpx  $ypx  $xpy  $ypy
   EndLoop
   
The results obtained indicate linearity relationship between extra beam tilt
(coma needed to be corrected) and image shift amount. And we also found that
for fixed condition, especially beam size, the bi-linear matrix remained
remarkably consistent. This provides a base for automatic correction of
coma induced by image shift. 

.. note::

   The linear matrix depends on scope alignment, specially Beam-Shift pivot
   points. We also fount that it is sensitive to beam size.

   On FEI microscope, image shift and beam shift are linked. The "action" of
   image shift results in image shifting below Obj lens AND beam shift above
   obj lens. 

Procedue to correct the coma induced by image-beam shift in SerialEM
--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. decide LD image conditions specially beam size (C2% or IA).
#. perform coma-free correction routine, SerialEM - Focus/Tune - Coma-free
   alignment by CTF
#. calibrate the linear matrix for current image condition, SerialEM -
   Calibration - Coma vs. Image Shift. 
#. save the SerialEM setting file. (yes, this calibreted matrix is saved in
   setting file.)
#. Setup multi-shot condition from SerialEM - Navigator - Montaging & Grids
   - Set Multi-shot Parameters..., and make sure the check box "adjust beam
   tilt to compensate ..." is checked, as shown below. 
   
   **Fig.1 Setup Multi-shot and Beam Tilt Compensation**

.. image:: ../images/multi-shot.png
   :scale: 75 %

.. note::

   There is a script command to retrieve the calibrated Coma vs ImageShift
   Matrix

   .. code-block:: ruby
   
      ReportComaVsISmatrix  xpx xpy ypx ypy

   It is very safe to change beam tilt this way, as beam tilt will always
   get restored to its original value after being corrected for this
   specific image shift. The exception is SerialEM program crash during the
   multi-shot routine finishes. If that happens, which is very rare, then
   one only needs to perform SerialEM - Focus/Tune - Coma-free alignment by
   CTF after restarting SerialEM. The matrix saved in the setting file
   should be still good as long as your beam size remains the same. 

As always, for details please read the helpfile related sections. Two of
them are:
