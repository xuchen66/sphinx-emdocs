.. glossary:: 

 Goal 
    This is to provide hands-on training on SerialEM. I will teach basic functions of the program. And I will teach how to use the powerful program for electron tomography data collection, and for single particle application as well. 

 Requirement 
    You are required to have basic knowledge for TEM operation, preferred for Tecnai/Titan/Talos system. You should be able to operate scope independently to get a properly foused image. You are *not* required, however, to have pre-knowledge of SerialEM itself. 

This document lists the training contents that are covered in the four catagories - basics, tomography, single particle and advanced topic.

.. note:: If you have any thought and suggetion to improvement the training, I love to hear them. 

.. _basic:

SerialEM - Basics (3 sessions)
------------------------------

.. rubric:: Session 1

- Introduction to SerialEM, launch and exit the program. Explain system files and user setting file.
- Explain how SerialEM controls microscope and camera, and its relationship with microscope and camera control software interfaces. 
- Explain SerialEM interface and layout - control panels and menus
- Camera setup, how to acquire an image from SerialEM interface
- Demo basic function such as Eucentricity (and shift beam to tilting axis)

.. rubric:: Session 2

- Refresh Tune-scope procedure
- Prepare gain reference file in SerialEM
- Explain image buffers and how to save buffer image into file, explain MRC stack and modes

.. _Tomography:

SerialEM - Tomography (5 sessions)
----------------------------------

.. rubric:: Session 1
