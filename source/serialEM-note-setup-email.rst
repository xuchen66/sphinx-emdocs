   Abstract
      SerialEM can send email; this feature has been there for a long time.
      I did not feel this was a must have so did not pay much attention to
      it. Now, we run scope 24/7 and like to get notification when something
      is wrong so we won't lose too much time. 
      
      Although setting up a standalone email server might not be the easist
      thing, setting up a SMTP server and relay service on K2 computer is
      not that hard. This is partially because K2 computer is running a
      server operating system - Windows 2008 R2.
      
      In this doc, I list what I have done to setup email notification on
      our SerialEM system.

Setup SMTP and Relay Service 
----------------------------

I followed instructions in an on-line article `Setup and Configure SMTP
Server on Windows Server 2008 R2
<http://www.vsysad.com/2012/04/setup-and-configure-smtp-server-on-windows-server-2008-r2/>`_.
It has images for each step and very easy to follow.

On SerialEM Part
----------------

There are a few steps we have to do on SerialEM side.

1. add two property lines in property file:

.. code:: Ruby 

   # SMTPserver
   SMTPServer     127.0.0.1  
   SendMailFrom   admin@talos-k2.cryoem.umassmed.edu
   
2. define email address to receive the notification. This from Tilt Series
   Menu - Set Email Address.
3. insert a command line in main collection script for single partile data
   collection. Location of this line doesn't matter. 
 
.. code:: Ruby

   ErrorBoxSendEmail Script Stopped!
  
4. check "Send email at end" in Acquire at points ... dialog window.
